# Diamond Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the price of diamonds based on various attributes such as carat weight, cut, clarity, color, and depth. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately estimate the price of a diamond given its characteristics.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e8/data?select=train.csv(https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e8/data?select=train.csv). It contains information about various diamonds, including their attributes and corresponding prices. The dataset is provided in csv format and can be found in the `data` directory. 

## Installation

To run the project locally, please ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

Once you have the dependencies, follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/diamond-price-prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd diamond-price-prediction`
3. Create a virtual environment (optional): `python -m venv env`
4. Activate the virtual environment (optional): `source env/bin/activate`
5. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
2. Open the `diamond_price_prediction.ipynb` notebook.
3. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and see the results.
4. Feel free to modify the code or experiment with different models and parameters.

## Results

The results of the diamond price prediction are evaluated based on various metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared score. These metrics provide insights into the performance of the model and how well it predicts diamond prices.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the project's code of conduct.
